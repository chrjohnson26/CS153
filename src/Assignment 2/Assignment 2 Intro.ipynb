    "## CS153 Assignment 2: Image Composition\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an introduction to some basic image processing that will extend the tools practiced in Assignment 1 in order to combine multiple images to form a new composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to provide a sandbox environment in which you can test your code and visually inspect the output. Note that when you make changes to a library that has already been imported into a notebook, you must restart the notebook kernel before those changes will be imported. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will not turn in this notebook; for code you only need to turn in your `A2.py` file. There will additionally be written questions that you will turn in on Gradescope, including a composition of your own design using this code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that your code will be evaluated in a manner very similar to this notebook (i.e. your `A2.py` file will be imported into a notebook, which will then run and the results inspected by myself or a grutor). That test notebook is not the same as this notebook, however; there will also be some additional tests for your code designed to ensure it is robustly implemented. You are encouraged to add your own tests to this notebook to make sure your code is stable and meets the expectations specified in the assignment."
